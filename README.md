# GumBOTchi

Your other bots can't say howdy can they?

## Howdy
`/howdy` is the cooler version of `/ping` and you know it. Can be used to check GumBOTchi's pulse.

## Pog  
Pog functionality is a random automatic response to someone saying "pog" or some variant of it. This can be used with messages or links.  
Responses are custom per discord server so you manage the responses yourself using `/pog` commands.

## Music
GumBOTchi has a very forward thinking music player. There is no `/play` command its just `/jukebox` once and go from there.  
Everything is controlled from the jukebox which reduces channel clutter  
Songs can be controlled and managed with the provided buttons  
 - Repeat button to cycle throught repeat types such as repeat and repeat one to loop the current queue
 - Play/Pause button to pause/resume the current song
 - Add button to add a song to the queue
 - Skip/Rewind to move to the next song or to reset the current song
 - Queue is paginated and can be navigated using the left/right buttons 

You can also queue previously played songs using the history select box.  
Just click one of the songs in the list and it will be requeued.
